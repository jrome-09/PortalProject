                            The University of Northern Philippines has its humble beginning as a shop department of the Old Vigan High School. Founded in 1906 and dedicated a year later, it started to play its vital role of training the youth in this part of the land for independent and democratic ways of life and to impress on the people, who were then still under the charm of Spanish aristocracy, the idea that the labor of the brawn is no less honorable than the labor of the brain – that the man who runs the machine is no less a child of God than the man who sits in the office.

                    In 1910, the Shop Department of the Vigan High School became a separate school of the intermediate level. It was then given the name Vigan Trade School. Seventeen years later, it embarked on a higher educational venture when it started offering its first secondary trade course. Twelve students were enrolled in the first year. Other course were offered later and in 1932, it made its first contribution of semi-skilled and skilled workers who were then (and even now) in great demand in a rapidly progressing nation. For the second time, the name of the school was changed to Ilocos Sur Trade School.
                    <br><br>
                    From 1927 to the years immediately after the Second World War, the school was supported by the provincial government. In 1951, by virtue of Republic Act No. 647, authored by Representative Floro S. Crisologo of the First District of Ilocos Sur, the Ilocos Sur Trade School was converted into a regional and national school of arts and trades known as the Northern Luzon School of Arts and Trades (NLSAT). It offered trade-technical courses above the secondary level to train the much-needed technical men who would transform into reality the dream of the government to achieve total economic and industrial development of the country. The school gave its first batch of graduate under the new trade-technical curriculum in 1956.
                    <br><br>
                    The rapid expansion of the courses offered in the school necessitated the acquisition of a new school site and the construction of a bigger building for the growing student population. Besides the trade courses for boys, trade courses for girls were added. Short unit courses were also given for those who needed only skills training. In 1955, the school transferred to its new and present site, a landscaped eight-hectare campus in Tamag, Vigan.
                    <br><br>
                    The name of the school was changed for the fourth time when, in 1960, under the General Appropriation Act, R.A. No. 2700, it became Ilocos Sur School of Arts and Trades.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1965, realizing the need of an institution for higher learning in this part of the country and the great amount of money spent each year to de-liver education in the municipality, Representative Floro S. Crisologo presented in Congress a bill which became R.A. No.4449 on June 19, 1965, converting the Ilocos Sur School of Arts and Trades into the University of Northern Philippines.
                    <br><br>
                    It is beyond one’s imagination to picture a school of arts and trades without a single college assuming the role of a university. But the University of Northern Philippines never faltered in moving forward, like the great strides it took in the past, though it took time to fill the great void. A period of adjustment was necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    On October 14, 1965, the Board of Regents was constituted. Dedicated leaders of the province were picked to compose the Board. Governor Carmeling Pichay Crisologo, known for her administrative and managerial abilities and for her sincere concern for the welfare of the University, Atty. Andres R. Asistin, Administrative Officer of the Bureau of Vocational Education and president of the UNP Alumni Association, and Mr. Pastor M. Obien (then Superintendent of the ISSAT) composed the Board. Mr. Obien was designated as Officer-In-Charge of the University and as such, became ipso facto chair of the Board. Mr. Bonifacio A. Rosales, Senior Executive Assistant II, was chosen the acting Secretary of the Board. In 1967, Atty. Eduardo Ma. Guirnalda, Provincial Board Secretary, became a member of the Board of Regents.
                    <br><br>
                    With vision projected towards the future and to the needs of the people of the North, the Board of Regents started shaping the path which the University will follow in its great educational venture. The College of Industrial Education was opened, then followed by the Liberal Arts offering courses in Pre-Engineering, Nursing, and Bachelor of Arts.
                    <br><br>
                    On August 18, 1966, the two-story Related Subjects Building, which housed the library and the Physics and Chemistry laboratories, was razed to the ground by a fire of unknown origin. But this did not hinder the educational activities of the University. Educational must go on and in due time, through the help of Congressman Floro S. Crisologo and Governor Carmeling Pichay Crisologo, the Board of Regents was able to find every means to replenish the books and equipment and provide the students with buildings.
                    <br><br>
                    As school year 1967-1968 ended, the University of Northern Philippines took pride in presenting its first contribution to the nation’s need for compe-tent industrial education teachers. The College of Industrial Education trium-phantly produced 34 graduates who eventually became Industrial Education teachers.
                    <br><br>
                    1967-1968 was just the beginning. The University of Northern Philippines, from a humble beginning, is expected to move on through the years bringing into fruitful reality the dream of Ilocos Sur’s greatest leaders today Congressman Floro S. Crisologo and Governor Carmeling Pichay Crisologo – to establish an institution of higher learning for the present and the future generation of the people of Ilocandia.
